# Welcome To DGiT!

## Quick Start Guide

Hi There! Before we embark on our journey through IT, I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to visit!
I am happy that you are interested in the World of IT! 
<br></br>
My name is Dom and I will be walking you though what power we have with IT in general and what we can achieve with it.

## The Run-through!

Please take your time to look through the pages we have created that will give you brief information on tools and how to
use them. These tools will be available to assist you and your business.
<br></br>
We are not promoted to sell and yet endorsed to force you in anyway to directly us thes tools but will be useful for your end-goals and yet
are not the best on the market. There are plenty of other resources out there but here you may find the correct ones with proper
guides and overview on usage with experience.
