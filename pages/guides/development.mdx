# Development - 101
<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸš€">Powered By GitHub Copilot</Callout>

## Lets Begin
Welcome to the bit where I talk to you about development! So, what are we going to cover you might ask?
<br></br>
Follow along and see...

### Software & Tools
Software is very important when it comes to being a sustainable and efficient developer. It is required that you are level-headed,
have a hard working etiquette and good at solving problems. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
More or less, you need to be creative. Myself, I have been doing design
work for quite while, studied in Graphic Design and worked through a web development company. I chose this path primarily as not only
is it needed in the world, but also give you insight on how you percieve things digitally.
<br></br>
Lets move away from me, and focus on you!

#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio is a must have tool for all kinds of development work. The ease of download and the sure pleasure of being able to customize
your IDE through themes and extentions is a MUST. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
Compared to Visual Studio 2019, we have a light-weight and basic IDE that is almost identical
to the imfamous Notepad++. It is perfect for all kinds of developers who like to write code, supports plugins and InteliSense to help write 
and offer help when needed, gives you all the correct information when you need it.
<br></br>
<br></br>
So why use it? It is free and supports multiple languages. It will also show you debugging methods, incorporates 'Go Live' which is handy for those
web developers. Being designed by Microsoft, we also can make out of computing from the cloud. Making use out of Azure and linking files to autosave
and pulling them into our space when we need can be extremely useful.

<br></br>

The same goes for GitHub. Github can be directly controlled from the IDE and
the CLI (Command Line Interface/Non GUI) the application comes with. The CLI can be changed as well to whatever you are working with, Python, CMD, PowerShell, Bash. You are able to
customize almost everything!

### GitHub
For all the Non-developers over here, keep scrolling... Right, now that we got you locked in as you saw GitHub above, lets talk you through the basics!
<br></br>
<br></br>
So, What is it? GitHub is an online tool (and now Desktop App) that can be accessed via CLI. This is very useful as we can technically use it for free
storage. It allows us to store our applications and code out of the way and we can also make extensive use out of the Version Control System. We are able
to upload our work and make commits to our files which will update the code upon pushing it. With GitHub, we are able to work with teams and invite people
into our workspaces to edit and commit code of their own.
<br></br>
<br></br>
With GitHub, we can make branches too. Branches can be very important when it comes to making seperate instances from the original. This allows us to make
stages or enviroments that we can work and manipulate code from.


### Languages
There are many different languages that you can use to develop. Some are more popular than others, but they all have their own uses. 

 - C#
 - C++
 - Java
 - Python
 - JavaScript
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - PHP
 - Ruby
 - Swift
 - Kotlin
 - Go
 - Rust
 - Dart
 - Scala
 - Haskell
   
   etc...

These languages all have different uses. Some are designed for web usage and some a made primarily for software and hardware development. If we look at JavaScript, CSS and HTML, we can see that these are used for web development. We can also see that C# and Java are used for software development. We can also see that C++ is used for both software and hardware development.

### Frameworks
Frameworks are a very important part of development. They are used to make the development process easier and more efficient. They are also used to make the code more readable and easier to understand. 

 - React
 - Angular
 - Vue
 - Ruby on Rails
 - Flask
 - Svelte
 - Next.js
 - Gatsby
 - Bootstrap
 - Tailwind
 - Material UI
 - Semantic UI
 - Bulma
 - Foundation
 - jQuery
 - Node.js
 - ASP.NET
 - .NET
 - Spring
 - Laravel
 - Django
 - Express

These are just a few of the frameworks that are used in development. There are many more that are used for different purposes. We would use React for web development, we would use .NET for software development and we would use Node.js for hardware development.

### Data, API's, SQL

#### Data
Data is a very important part of development. We need to be able to store data and retrieve it when needed. We can do this through SQL. SQL is a language that is used to store and retrieve data. We can also use API's to store and retrieve data. API's are a way of storing data and retrieving it when needed. We can also use API's to make requests to other websites and get data from them.

Data is everything and everything is data. Every barcode or every item in a supermarket is data to us and to the machines monitoring the stock and all the workers stocking the shelves. Data is everywhere and we need to be able to store it and retrieve it when needed. We can do this through SQL and API's. 

How would a supermarket utilize data efficiently and effectively? They would use SQL to store the data and API's to retrieve it when needed. They would also use API's to make requests to other supermarkets and get data from them. As well, they might capture user and customer data to find out more about how many people visit a supermarket or they might capture path data to find out who is visiting the supermarket and how often they visit and also how long they spend in the supermarket.

Ontop of the customers, we have stock management systems that would be put into place in each and every supermarket. They are not however, bespoke. They are designed to be more or less to work with every store around the franchisee or the main busniess. This allows the bosses to monitor stock levels and how much stock is being sold. These are usually designed with a flashy UI called a Dashboard. This will be used to be able to see what is happening with graphs and charts. These are usually designed with a framework called React.

#### API's
One of the more complicated topics within programming and development. However, we use API's nearly everyday and all the time in our digital lives. API's are a way of storing data and retrieving it when needed. We can also use API's to make requests to other websites and get data from them. 

We can use a platform such as Reddit or YouTube and utilize the search bar. Each time we use that search bar, we are calling from an API which links to the organised and structured database. This database is then searched and the results are returned to us. We can also use API's to make requests to other websites and get data from them. Reddit will API's to send data to certain threads, subreddits and users. They will make use of referencing so that the posts can link the user to the subreddit and the subreddit to the user.

Basically, we would use API's to make requests to data. A frontend developer will take the data and display it in a way that is easy to read and understand. A backend developer will take the data and store it in a way that might be more complicated but will be readable and understandable to the team behind the scenes. The frontend developer can make use out of variables to make sure that the data be shown in certain fields across the site. How very interesting...

#### SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language that is used to store and retrieve data. We can also use API's to store and retrieve data. API's are a way of storing data and retrieving it when needed. We can also use API's to make requests to other websites and get data from them. SQL is a language for DB engineers and developers. It helps structure our databases and also make changes to our databases remotely. We can also use SQL to make changes to our databases locally. 

Some developers for certain software can write and automate the SQL code to link their programs up. A great example of this is FiveM and the QBCore community. QBCore is a framework that is driven and backed by thousands of people. It is a framework that is used to make roleplay servers for GTA V. The framework is written in Lua and the SQL is written in SQL. The SQL is used to store and retrieve data from the database. The Lua is used to make the framework work and also make the framework more efficient and effective. Upon creation of a server, we are able to use the SQL to create the database and then we are able to use the Lua to make the framework work. The SQL is written for us automatically by the webserver, this can then be ran so that the server can be created.


### Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is a giant step for mankind. It allows us to store our data in a secure and safe place. We can also use it to store our applications and code. We can also use it to store our databases and make use of the SQL language to make changes to our databases. We can also use it to make use of the API's to make requests to other websites and get data from them. Cloud Computing is a very important part of development and it is a very important part of our lives. Especially within this document. You see, Cloud Computing allows for more resources hosted by the cloud provider. This allows for more storage, more bandwidth and more processing power. This allows for more efficient and effective development. We can look at AWS servers and hosting that make use of Cloud Computing and they sell it to us for a monthly fee. This allows us to make use of the resources that they provide and we can make use of them to make our lives easier and more efficient.

A lot of companies wil start to move over to Cloud Computing as it way more secure and low maintenance. However, depending on the need, it can come at a cost. This can be very expensive for large companies but small ones not so much. We would usually pay for cloud storage which is more secure and keeps everything backed up whatever it may be. As well we can look at OpenAI which is now more and more opensource and more available to the public. We are able to use systems such as DALLE-2 which is a new and upcoming AI generating application which is useful for a number of creative reasons. The system is programmed to allow for the AI to generate random images with realistic art skills that replicate a Kandinsky or a Picasso. This is a very interesting and exciting development and it is a very important part of development for the entire world.
