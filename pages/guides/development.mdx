# Development - 101

## Lets Begin
Welcome to the bit where I talk to you about development! So, what are we going to cover you might ask?
<br></br>
Follow along and see...

### Software & Tools
Software is very important when it comes to being a sustainable and efficient developer. It is required that you are level-headed,
have a hard working etiquette and good at solving problems. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
More or less, you need to be creative. Myself, I have been doing design
work for quite while, studied in Graphic Design and worked through a web development company. I chose this path primarily as not only
is it needed in the world, but also give you insight on how you percieve things digitally.
<br></br>
Lets move away from me, and focus on you!

#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio is a must have tool for all kinds of development work. The ease of download and the sure pleasure of being able to customize
your IDE through themes and extentions is a MUST. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
Compared to Visual Studio 2019, we have a light-weight and basic IDE that is almost identical
to the imfamous Notepad++. It is perfect for all kinds of developers who like to write code, supports plugins and InteliSense to help write 
and offer help when needed, gives you all the correct information when you need it.
<br></br>
<br></br>
So why use it? It is free and supports multiple languages. It will also show you debugging methods, incorporates 'Go Live' which is handy for those
web developers. Being designed by Microsoft, we also can make out of computing from the cloud. Making use out of Azure and linking files to autosave
and pulling them into our space when we need can be extremely useful.

The same goes for GitHub. Github can be directly controlled from the IDE and
the CLI (Command Line Interface/Non GUI) the application comes with. The CLI can be changed as well to whatever you are working with, Python, CMD, PowerShell, Bash. You are able to
customize almost everything!

### GitHub
For all the Non-developers over here, keep scrolling... Right, now that we got you locked in as you saw GitHub above, lets talk you through the basics!
<br></br>
<br></br>
So, What is it? GitHub is an online tool (and now Desktop App) that can be accessed via CLI. This is very useful as we can technically use it for free
storage. It allows us to store our applications and code out of the way and we can also make extensive use out of the Version Control System. We are able
to upload our work and make commits to our files which will update the code upon pushing it. With GitHub, we are able to work with teams and invite people
into our workspaces to edit and commit code of their own.
<br></br>
<br></br>
With GitHub, we can make branches too. Branches can be very important when it comes to making seperate instances from the original. This allows us to make
stages or enviroments that we can work and manipulate code from.
